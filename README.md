# Youtube-video-uploader
   This application is used to upload any video to your Youtube channel.  
   For this functionality I used Youtube api which is provided by Google where users should authorize and give access from this application to make changes.  
   After the uploading process is completed application will render new component where you can see your video and a youtube link for your video.
